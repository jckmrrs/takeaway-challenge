The nouns were split into owners & properties.
The actions were split into who owned them.
The actions were then given the properties that they read/write.
This resulted in:

class       --> dishes
properties  --> cost of dishes
            --> name of dishes
actions     --> read

class       --> total
properties  --> list of dishes
            --> current order
actions     --> add to order
            --> read order
            --> sum order

class       --> text
properties  --> total
            --> time
            --> order completed
actions     --> send
